
Step-1: **Read Emails from Files:**
   - Read the emails from both `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` and store them in separate lists or sets.

Step-2: **Print Emails Present in Both Files:**
   - Create an empty set to store common emails.
   - Iterate through the emails in one of the sets.
   - Check if each email exists in the other set. If it does, add it to the common emails set.
   - Print the common emails set.

Step-3: **Print Emails Present in File1 but Not in File2:**
   - Create a copy of the emails set from `file1.txt`.
   - Remove all the emails that are also present in the emails set from `file2.txt`.
   - Print the remaining emails in the copy.

Step-4: **Print Emails Present in File2 but Not in File1:**
   - Create a copy of the emails set from `file2.txt`.
   - Remove all the emails that are also present in the emails set from `file1.txt`.
   - Print the remaining emails in the copy.

Step-5: **Print All Unique Emails in Both Files:**
   - Create a union of the emails sets from both files to get all unique emails.
   - Print the union set.
